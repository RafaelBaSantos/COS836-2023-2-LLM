These ancient artifacts contain remnants of forgotten knowledge and forgotten magic, a glimpse into a bygone era. Luna suggests that delving into these data chips may provide them with valuable insights and potentially shed light on the anonymous request they've received.\n\nLuna looks at Sable \"Neon\" Drift and Kai \"Razor\" Thornton, and says, \"My friends, I believe these data chips hold hidden secrets that might aid us in our journey. If we can decipher their contents, we may uncover valuable information about the anonymous request and the Neonites. What do you think? Shall we delve into the past and see what we can find?\"\n\nWhat do you do next?",

These ancient artifacts contain remnants of forgotten knowledge and forgotten magic, a glimpse into a bygone era. Luna suggests that delving into these data chips may provide them with valuable insights and potentially shed light on the anonymous request they've received.\n\nLuna looks at Sable \"Neon\" Drift and Kai \"Razor\" Thornton, and says, \"My friends, I believe these data chips hold hidden secrets that might aid us in our journey. If we can decipher their contents, we may uncover valuable information about the anonymous request and the Neonites. What do you think? Shall we delve into the past and see what we can find?\"\n\nWhat do you do next?"
