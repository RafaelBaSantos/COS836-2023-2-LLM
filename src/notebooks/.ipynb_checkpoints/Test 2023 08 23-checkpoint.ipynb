    "Think concisely about an original and engaging world. You should consider the following aspects, but never talk about them directly:\n",
    "    - The genre is cyberpunk fantasy;\n",
    "    - The world brings a hopeless feeling;\n",
    "    - The tone of the story is dark;\n",
    "    - The level of technology is futuristic;\n",
    "    - Magic is seen as something ultra-rare and forgotten;\n",
    "    - The atmosphere is dystopic;\n",
    "    - The story is inspired by writers Isaac Asimov, Greg Bear, Frank Herbert, William Gibson, Philip K. Dick;\n",
    "    - The story is inspired by the universe of Cyberpunk 2077, Lancer RPG, BladeRunner, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop.\n",
    "    - The story deals with more or less 4 of the following subjects: Governance and its influence, Legal principles and rule of law, Provision of social services, Economic dynamics, Equity in wealth distribution, Agricultural practices and trade, Interpersonal relationships influenced by race, class, gender or sexual orientation, Military power and influence, Role and influence of religion, Technological advances and influences, Impact of arts and cultural expressions, Geographical features, Interactions between civilizations, their histories and conflicts, Foundations of the laws of nature, Theories about the origin of the universe, History of species and cultures that have inhabited the world, Needs and interactions of different species and cultures.\n",
    "    - When describing any entity (location, object, character, species, condition, conflict, organization, title, myth, etc.), you must provide specific names and brief descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2:\n",
    "Find the main topics in this story, that could be better developed, and think of a list of topics and a brief explanation of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3:\n",
    "Identify the entities in the text. An entity can be a noun or a noun phrase that refers to a real-world object or an abstract concept. You can use a named entity recognition (NER) tool or a part-of-speech (POS) tagger to identify the entities.\n",
    "Each entity should have a name, a label, and a detailed description. The label can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place: Physical places, such as continents, cities, mountains, or forests;\n",

    "- Item: Tangible items or documents. Examples: weapons, clothes, letters, and books.\n",
    "- Species: Biological or cultural groups. Examples: elves, humans, and dogs.\n",
    "- Organization: Groups with common purposes. Examples: churches, governments, and sects.\n",
    "- Condition: Physical or emotional states. Examples: illness, inspiration, sadness.\n",
    "- Drama: Challenges, sociocultural tensions, or military conflicts. Examples: military influence, class relations, and economic problems.\n",
    "- Myth: Narratives, beliefs, or prose. Examples: legends about the origin of the universe, and myths of monsters.\n",

    "- Step 4\n",
    "Identify the relationships between the entities. A relationship can be a verb or a prepositional phrase that connects two entities. You can use dependency parsing to identify the relationships.\n",

    "An \"adventure\" is a complete story, with a beginning, middle and end.\n",
    "In this RPG, the measurement of time is not precise, but is done through \"scenes\", which are segments of the story, not fixed units of time. Scenes can begin when a new location or situation is introduced, ending when the characters leave that location or resolve the situation. Scenes can be interrupted, giving way to a new scene. In this way, the master has control over the use of the characters' powers during the game. Scenes are also useful as tools for creating the adventure. Scenes are categorized into three types: action scenes, exploration scenes and role-playing scenes.\n",
    "- Action scenes: Seek to conquer something physically, usually involving battles, chases or traps. The pace is fast, with the game divided into rounds and unexpected events occurring frequently. The characters' lives are regularly at risk, so the importance of gameplay prevails. However, too many action scenes can leave the characters lacking in personality, while too few can make the plot stagnant and predictable.\n",
    "- Exploration scenes: In adventure games aim to achieve something intellectual by interacting with environments or objects, not people. This can involve searching for clues at a crime scene, solving puzzles, or exploring new lands. Exploration may present no challenges, but it can also involve difficult tasks, such as deciphering old books in search of secrets. While rules and tests may be relevant, the players' ideas are key. Excessive exploration scenes can result in a game dominated by descriptions, with little player action. However, a lack of exploration can lead to a game with no surprises and predictable environments.\n",
    "- Role-playing scenes: Involve dialog and emotional interactions between characters. Even if there isn't always a goal, these scenes often help advance the story. They are opportunities for players to explore their characters' personalities. The game master may need to conduct tests and use rules in conflict situations. However, too many role-playing scenes can make the adventure slow and excessively detailed. On the other hand, a lack of role-playing can make characters just a set of numbers, making even the death of a character irrelevant, since the player can simply create another one.\n",
